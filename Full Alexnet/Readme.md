All layers of the Alexnet architecture, activation functions and all necessary functions, as well as the writing of the entire structure of the architecture within the main function, were carried out in the full_alexnet_code.c file. All Alexnet architecture and all of these functions in it were written with our own effort and were not taken from anywhere.
