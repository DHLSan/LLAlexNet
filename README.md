# LLAlexNet

In this Github repo, it is aimed to write the Alexnet architecture in C code and accelerate it using the Zynq-7000 System On Chip device. To write Alexnet architecture in C code, 3 Github folders have been created these are Preparation stages of Alexnet C code, Alexnet Python and Full Alexnet files. The preparation stages of Alexnet C code file contains the codes and tests written during the construction of the layers, activation functions and other necessary functions required for the creation of the architecture.

The Alexnet Python file contains the ready python code of the Alexnet architecture, and how to run this code is explained in the Readme.md file in the file. In this section, we have transferred the trained weight files to the txt file with a few lines of code that we added to the python file.
