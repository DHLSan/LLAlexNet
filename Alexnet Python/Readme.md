This file contains Alexnet python code written using tensorflow. The original code is taken from https://github.com/hjptriplebee. In order to run the code, test images must be uploaded and a trained weight file must be downloaded from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/bvlc_alexnet.npy. After these conditions are met, the Alexnet architecture is run by running the testModel.py code. We added lines 58, 59, 61 and 64 to the testModel.py code and converted the weight files used in the architecture to numpy array format and then printed them to the txt file. By doing this, we aimed to get the trained weight parameters in the C code we wrote and to run them correctly. As can be seen on line 64, variables[] values are written and parameters are drawn. The value written in variables[] and the information about which layer is drawn are specified in the weights_explanation file.
