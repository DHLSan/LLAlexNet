In this file, there are test codes we made to implement our Alexnet architecture in C language. First of all, various attempts were made by writing the neural_lowlevel.py code in order to understand the logic of the neural network structure. Then, the maxpooling layer was written in C code by giving a 2-dimensional input value and transferred to the maxpool_deneme1.c file. Studies were carried out on the convolution layer, which is the most important layer of architecture, and various experiments were made with 2D input. These trials are seen in the convlayer_2dimension.c file. After that, the process of passing the 3D input to the convolution layer and writing a C function in the padding were performed in the file conv_3dimension.
