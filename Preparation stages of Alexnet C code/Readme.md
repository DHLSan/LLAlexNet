In this file, there are test codes we made to implement our Alexnet architecture in C language. First of all, various attempts were made by writing the neural_lowlevel.py code in order to understand the logic of the neural network structure. Then, the maxpooling layer was written in C code by giving a 2-dimensional input value and transferred to the maxpool_deneme1.c file. Studies were carried out on the convolution layer, which is the most important layer of architecture, and various experiments were made with 2D input. These trials are seen in the convlayer_2dimension.c file. After that, the process of passing the 3D input to the convolution layer and writing a C function in the padding were performed in the file conv_3dimension. The fully connected layer, which is the last layer of the Alexnet architecture, and its activation functions have also been tested in the last_fullyconnect_bias.c file. In addition, the flatten operation required to switch to the fully connected layer has been achieved by writing the flatten C function.
